I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Delaware. I graduated with a PhD from Rutgers University where my advisor was [Danny Krashen](http://dkrashen.github.io/about/) and I am generally interested in studying algebraic objects such as central simple algebras and the Brauer group over different fields, and applying the techniques of field patching to solve field arithmetic problems.
