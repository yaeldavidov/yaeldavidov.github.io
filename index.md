I am a sixth year graduate student at Rutgers University studying group admissibility problems over semi-global fields. My advisor is [Danny Krashen](http://dkrashen.github.io/about/) and I am generally interested in studying algebraic objects such as central simple algebras and the Brauer group over different fields, and applying the techniques of field patching to solve field arithmetic problems.
